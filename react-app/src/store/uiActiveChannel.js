//! could use redux stores to save states on channel buttons and maybe the add server button, like for example,
//! whenever a server icon is pushed it will dispatch to the add icon store to set active to false,
//! when you click on add server icon it will change its active to true.
/*
! for the channels, it can be the same thing maybe? it will store an object on the active channel if the active channel
 ! store matches the clicked channel, then the elements class will be active. object will have channel id and active status.
 ! so when a user clicks on a different channel it will swap the active channel id..
